#Machine Learning Basics
What I Learned Today

Today I learned what Machine Learning is.
Machine Learning is a way for computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Simple Definition
Machine Learning means: Teaching a computer using data so it can learn and improve by itself.

Real-Life Examples
1. YouTube recommending videos
2. Email spam detection
3. Predicting exam results
4. Weather prediction

Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning: Data has input and output
Example: Predicting marks, house price

2. Unsupervised Learning :Data has no output
Example: Grouping similar customers

3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning using reward and punishment
Example: Games, robots

Basic ML Steps
--->Collect data
--->Prepare data
--->Train the algorithm
--->Evaluate it
--->If it is good 
--->launch it 
--->Else , analyze the error
